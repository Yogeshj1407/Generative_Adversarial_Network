# Generative_Adversarial_Network
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other. The generator creates new data samples, such as images or text, while the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and generated samples
